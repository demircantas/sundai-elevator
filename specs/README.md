# Concept Specifications

This folder contains the formal specifications for each concept in the application, following the Concept Design methodology. Each `.concept` file describes the purpose, state, and actions of a single concept, and is the source of truth for its implementation.

- Each concept spec should be named `<ConceptName>.concept`.
- See the rules in `rules/concept-design.mdc` and `rules/concept-state-specification.mdc` for details.
